# Restore Assets

Clean Project keeps track of original asset locations using a manifest file.

---

## How Restore Works

- Assets moved to `Assets/_Cleanup`
- Original paths are stored internally
- Restore moves assets back to their original location

---

## Restore Steps

1. Open **Tools → Clean Project → Restore**
2. Select assets
3. Click **Restore Selected**
